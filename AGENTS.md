# Agent instructions

These rules apply to every AI coding agent working in this repository (Claude
Code, Codex, Gemini, and others). The full contributor guide is
[docs/CONTRIBUTING.md](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Pull requests

- Branch from the active `release/x.y.z` (or `release/x.y.x`) branch and open
  the PR into that same branch. Never target `main`; only a maintainer's
  release PR does.
- Title the PR `Release/x.y.z: Describe the change` (or `Release/x.y.x: …`),
  using the same major and minor version as the target branch. CI rejects
  other titles.
- Write the PR description however suits the change, but it **must** name
  its issues. Use a line `Closes #123` for each issue it finishes. Use
  `Part of #123` or `Related to #123` for an issue it only advances or
  touches, so that issue stays open. The **PR Linked Issue** check fails
  without one, and it reruns when you edit the description. The line goes in
  the description, not only in a commit message or the title.
- A release PR from `release/x.y.z` into `main` must repeat every `Closes #…`
  line from the feature PRs it includes. GitHub only closes issues when the
  reference reaches `main`.
- Say what you tested, with the command and result (for example `npm test`,
  430 passing). Mention any Android or iOS build you ran.

## Safety

- Never commit secrets, private keys, certificates, passwords, `.env` files,
  or generated signing artifacts. Workflow changes must not print secrets,
  dump environments, or upload secret-bearing files.
- This is a public repository. Keep personal names, personal email addresses,
  account IDs, and descriptions of unfixed security gaps out of code, commits,
  PRs, and issues.
- Use made-up names in tests, fixtures, examples, and docs. Never copy names or
  other details from real rosters, spreadsheets, bulletins, or screenshots.
- Strip hidden metadata (author names, account IDs, GPS locations) from images
  before committing them: `node scripts/strip-image-metadata.cjs <file>`.
  `test/image-metadata.test.ts` fails if a committed image still has any.
- Never set Android `versionCode` or iOS `buildNumber` in `app.json`. Both are
  computed from the version; see
  [Version numbers](docs/operations/version-numbers.md).
