# Web and native builds

Web/PWA preview deployment remains automatic on pushes to `main` through the canonical
GitHub workflow. Local `npm run deploy` builds the web output without publishing it.
Signed native builds run only after a change reaches `main`; `release/**` branches are
source/release-management branches, not signed-build targets. The Android PR preview is a
separate credential-free path for unsigned debug APKs in ARM and Intel variants. Fork PRs do
not receive Linux checks from this native-build documentation path; they are limited to the
unsigned debug APK preview policy. Native iOS does not run on pull requests at all. It runs
only from `main` after merge (or an explicitly approved manual run on `main`). Native builds
upload to TestFlight and Google Play internal testing only; nothing is released to the public
automatically (see [Automatic store uploads](#automatic-store-uploads)). Native iOS and Android are the primary release targets; the
web/PWA build is retained for browser testing and previews. The same Expo source is
used for all platforms.

## Current migration status

Android uses the zero-Expo-authentication build path. The repository contains a
config plugin that teaches the generated Gradle project to use a keystore supplied
through environment variables, and `npm run build:android` /
`npm run build:android:apk` use `expo prebuild` followed by Gradle directly.
The intended GitHub configuration keeps the four Android signing values in the
protected `production` Environment. The workflow decodes only the base64 keystore
into `$RUNNER_TEMP`, derives `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PATH` from that temporary location,
and exposes the signing values only to the Gradle invocation that signs the binary.
The path is not itself a secret, and no keystore or password is passed to Expo
prebuild. Android builds do not need an Expo account, an Expo token, or EAS
credential storage. Its job-level guard permits signed runs only from
trusted `main`; the manual dispatch cannot attach the
production Environment to an arbitrary ref. If the values were initially entered
as ordinary repository secrets, move them to the protected Environment and remove
the repository-level copies before the first signed release run.

The direct-native iOS workflow is now checked in separately as
`.github/workflows/native-ios-build.yml`. It runs only on trusted pushes to `main` and
manual dispatch from `main`; it has no pull-request signing path. All signing paths require
the protected `production` Environment. It uses a
GitHub-hosted macOS runner with Expo prebuild and Xcode. The church added its Apple
signing secrets to the `production` Environment in September 2026; how they were
created is in [App Store and Google Play setup](app-store-setup.md). It does not use
EAS or an Expo token.
The repository no longer depends on an Expo account; keep any external account only if
the church wants to preserve unrelated project history.

### Local Expo template lookup

`scripts/build-android-native.mjs` reuses an existing generated `android/` project
for repeat local builds. This avoids an unnecessary npm registry metadata lookup for
`expo-template-bare-minimum@58.0.9`, including when `--no-install` is used. A clean
GitHub Actions checkout still runs Expo prebuild. When `app.json`, a native config
plugin, or another native setting changes, force regeneration with either:

```bash
npm run build:android:apk:debug -- --prebuild
EXPO_PREBUILD=true npm run build:android:apk:debug
```

The execution environment may still require network approval for a clean prebuild;
that permission is controlled by the runner or sandbox, not by repository settings.

The Android `versionCode` and the iOS build number are computed from the version by
`app.config.js` (`0.40.0` becomes `40000`), so nobody sets them by hand; see
[Version numbers](version-numbers.md). Do not build a signed AAB on a release branch
before the final merge; build the signed artifact only after the release commit
reaches `main`.

## Decision rationale and risk register

| Decision | Reason | Remaining risk / control |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Build Android with prebuild + Gradle | Removes Expo authentication and EAS credential custody from Android while using the public repository's free standard Linux runner | Expo template, Gradle, Java, SDK, and NDK updates still need periodic validation |
| Keep native directories ignored | Expo Continuous Native Generation makes `app.json` and config plugins the source of truth and avoids hand-edited generated files | A clean prebuild can overwrite manual native edits; keep native behavior in config/plugins |
| Store Android signing values in the protected GitHub Environment | Google retains the final Play app-signing key; CI needs only the upload key and four narrowly scoped values, while GitHub provides reviewer approval and branch controls | Repository-level copies weaken environment scoping; keep the four values only in `production`, require approval, restrict trusted refs, use least privilege, and review Actions |
| Do not rotate the Android key annually | Upload keys do not expire annually; keeping the same key preserves the Play update path | Maintain encrypted backups; use Play's upload-key reset process after loss or compromise |
| Build iOS with prebuild + Xcode | Removes Expo authentication and EAS credential custody from iOS while using trusted-branch or manual macOS workflows | Apple certificate/profile renewal and Xcode/runner updates still need periodic validation |
| Upload automatically to testing only | Testers get every release without anyone moving files by hand, while the public release stays a manual step in each console | Store credentials are in a separate `store-upload` environment and job that runs no npm packages; the first Play upload was made by hand, as Play requires |
| Do not build signed binaries before `main` | Production signing material is reserved for the post-merge `main` build. | Pull-request previews remain unsigned debug APKs for ARM and Intel; fork PRs do not receive signed builds or Linux native checks |

This is why the migration is not just “put the JKS in a GitHub secret.” The
keystore must be the key Google expects, the version code must be monotonic, the
workflow must restore and delete the secret safely, and the resulting AAB must
be tested as an update. These controls matter more than the build command itself.

### Why the final credential boundary is a GitHub Environment

The final design is a protected GitHub `production` Environment, not a general
repository-secret bucket. Environment secrets are limited to jobs that name that
Environment and are made available only after its protection rules—especially
required-reviewer approval—have passed. Repository secrets are available to all
workflows in the repository and are read earlier in the workflow lifecycle. See
GitHub's [secrets reference](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/security/secrets)
and [deployment-environment guidance](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/concepts/workflows-and-actions/deployment-environments).

The Android workflow still references the normal `${{ secrets.NAME }}` context;
the job's `environment: production` determines which Environment-level values are
available. If the same name exists at repository and Environment scope, the
Environment value takes precedence, but keeping duplicates is confusing and
weakens the intended boundary. Therefore the four Android values must be added to
`production`, verified with a protected run, and then removed from Repository
secrets. `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PATH` remains a derived runner-temporary path rather
than a stored credential, and `EXPO_TOKEN` has no role in this architecture.

### Android PR preview and Drive upload

The signed **Native Android build** workflow intentionally runs only after a commit reaches
`main`; it does not sign release-branch or pull-request commits. The separate **Android PR
preview** workflow is credential-free and is reserved for unsigned debug APK previews in
ARM and Intel variants. Fork PRs do not receive Linux native checks or production signing;
the only native artifact permitted by this policy is an unsigned debug APK preview. The
workflow runs automatically for release pull requests into `main`, from a `release/*`
branch in this repository.
It does not accept manual commit or pull-request SHA inputs and does not use dependency
caching while executing PR code in the `pull_request_target` context.

For an automatic PR run, a separate protected `production` Environment job downloads only
the APK artifact and checks out the upload helper from the trusted base commit. It does not
check out or execute PR code while the Google credential is available. The helper refreshes
the existing `CLASPRC_JSON` OAuth token and
uploads a private APK file to the connected user's My Drive root. The OAuth account must
retain the `drive.file` scope. If a dedicated folder is later preferred, set
`GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID` in the protected upload job and pass it to the helper.

Automatic PR runs require the credential-free preview guard; configure `production` with
required reviewers and a `main` deployment-branch policy if Drive uploads should require a
human approval. The build job receives no signing credentials, and fork PRs are skipped.
The Drive upload job must remain separate from the build job, and the upload helper must be
checked out from the trusted base commit rather than the PR head.

## Credential-custody decision

The release pipeline compiles Android directly on a GitHub-hosted Linux runner
with Gradle and iOS directly on a GitHub-hosted macOS runner with Xcode. Neither
workflow uses EAS CLI, Expo authentication, or an EAS Cloud builder.

The intended credential boundary for the church-owned project is GitHub Actions:

| Credential | Custodian | CI location |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Android upload keystore | Church / Google Play account | Protected `production` Environment secret |
| Google Play service-account key | Church / Google Play account | Separate protected `production` Environment secret, not currently configured |
| Apple distribution certificate (`.p12`) | Church Apple Developer account | Protected `production` Environment secret |
| Apple App Store provisioning profile | Church Apple Developer account | Protected `production` Environment secret |
| App Store Connect API key (`.p8`) | Church App Store Connect account | Separate protected `production` Environment secret, not currently configured |

The Android keystore above is the **upload key**, not Google's Play app-signing key.
With Play App Signing, Google protects the final signing key and the CI pipeline only
needs the upload key. The App Store Connect `.p8` key is for submission automation;
it is separate from the Apple distribution certificate and provisioning profile.

No signing or submission credentials are stored with a build vendor. The native
workflows restore only the files needed for that run from GitHub Environment
secrets and remove them afterward.

### Current versus target configuration

The Android direct-native path is now active in the repository. Its committed
config plugin changes only the generated `android/app/build.gradle`; it reads
`ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PATH`, `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS`, and
`ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD` at Gradle runtime. The workflow decodes
`ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64` into the runner's temporary directory, builds an AAB or
APK, uploads the artifact, and removes the keystore in an `always()` cleanup step.
The private key is never committed or included in a build artifact.

The iOS GitHub job now uses direct Xcode archive/export. Before the first direct
iOS release, the implementation must:

1. Restore an Apple distribution `.p12` and App Store provisioning profile only
   inside a protected GitHub job, using a temporary keychain.
2. Create an explicit `xcodebuild archive` and `xcodebuild -exportArchive` path,
   with an export-options plist generated from configuration rather than secrets
   committed to source.
3. Use a protected production Environment, required approval, and a `main`-only
   push or manual-dispatch guard for jobs that can read Apple signing secrets.
4. Compute the iOS build number from the version; see
   [Version numbers](version-numbers.md).
5. Upload the artifact to TestFlight and verify an update install on a physical
   iPhone; see [Automatic store uploads](#automatic-store-uploads).

The workflow's `main`-only guard is an important part of this boundary and must remain.
Secrets must be configured in the church's upstream repository/Environment; they are
not shared automatically with the CodeSammich fork.

### Native build workflow

1. Run `npx expo prebuild` to generate temporary `android/` and `ios/` projects.
2. Restore signing material from GitHub Environment secrets.
3. Build Android with Gradle (`bundleRelease`/`assembleRelease`).
4. Build and export iOS with Xcode (`xcodebuild archive` and
   `xcodebuild -exportArchive`).
5. Delete native projects and signing files after the job.

This removes the Expo account and token dependency, but it is not a package-only
change. The workflows own Android signing configuration, an iOS temporary keychain
and export options, and version-code/build-number injection. Store upload remains a
separate manual step.
Keep native customization in `app.json` and config plugins; Expo warns that manual
changes to generated projects can be overwritten by a later clean prebuild. See
[Continuous Native Generation](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/continuous-native-generation/)
and [config plugins](https://docs.expo.dev/config-plugins/introduction/).

The one-time portion is the workflow setup, signing configuration, and initial
upload of the GitHub secrets. Ongoing maintenance is bounded but not zero: Apple
distribution profiles expire after 12 months, certificates may need replacement,
and GitHub eventually retires runner images. Xcode updates are normally handled by
changing the runner/Xcode selection in workflow YAML and running a validation build;
they are not generally `package.json` updates. Expo/React Native SDK upgrades may
also require dependency changes and a new prebuild validation.

## GitHub Actions minutes and maintenance

For a public repository, standard GitHub-hosted runners—including standard macOS
runners—are currently free. For a private repository, GitHub Free and GitHub Free
for organizations currently include 2,000 standard-runner minutes per month. macOS
has a substantially higher private-repository billing rate than Linux, so budget an
iOS minute as roughly ten Linux-equivalent minutes. The exact allowance and rates
belong to the repository owner's GitHub plan; check [GitHub Actions billing](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/concepts/product-billing/github-actions)
before relying on a quota.

The automatic native workflow can run two signed Android jobs on a `main` push: Android
AAB and Android APK. The iOS workflow is separate and runs only on a trusted `main`
push or a manual dispatch from `main`; it never runs as a pull-request build. PR native
previews are unsigned Android debug APKs for ARM and Intel, not signed release builds.
The unsigned **iOS PR preview** adds two macOS jobs, Apple Silicon and Intel, to
each release PR into `main`; see [iOS PR preview](#ios-pr-preview-unsigned-simulator-builds). A rough
private-repository estimate for the automatic Android workflow is:

```text
Linux-equivalent minutes per run ≈ Android AAB minutes + Android APK minutes
```

For example, a 15-minute AAB plus 10-minute APK run is about 25 Linux-equivalent
minutes. An iOS run is counted separately for each `main` push or manual dispatch.
This is an estimate, not a measured guarantee; use completed workflow durations from
GitHub's Actions usage view. Keep signed builds restricted to `main` pushes or
manual dispatch from `main`, add concurrency cancellation,
retain artifacts only as long as needed,
and configure GitHub to stop usage at the account budget rather than silently incur
charges.

The current `Native Android build` workflow has no `pull_request` trigger, so it does not
start a signed build for every PR or every new commit pushed to a PR. The iOS workflow also
has no pull-request signing path; it runs from the `main` push after merge or from a manual
`main` dispatch. Plan approximately as follows
for a private GitHub Free organization, assuming the rough 10× macOS billing weight:

| iOS runner time | Approximate iOS builds from 2,000 Linux-equivalent minutes |
| ---: | ---: |
| 10 minutes | 20 |
| 20 minutes | 10 |
| 30 minutes | 6 |
| 45 minutes | 4 |

These counts exclude Android jobs and other workflows, and every pushed revision or
manual rerun counts as another job. PR native previews are limited to unsigned ARM and
Intel debug APKs; signed iOS builds remain reserved for the post-merge `main` path or
manual dispatch from `main`. If the upstream repository is public, the
standard macOS runner is currently free and unlimited, though concurrency and fair-use
limits still apply. See [GitHub's runner reference](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/runners/github-hosted-runners).

The direct native approaches have similar platform-tool maintenance:

| Area | Maintenance required |
| --- | --- |
| Expo/React Native | Update dependencies and rerun prebuild checks when SDK/native dependencies change |
| GitHub runner | Review `runs-on`, Xcode, Node, Java, Android SDK, and NDK versions when images retire |
| iOS | Renew distribution certificates/profiles and retest after Xcode updates |
| Android | Keep the upload keystore backed up; reset it through Play if compromised |
| Workflow | Keep signing/upload steps, cleanup traps, permissions, and action versions current |

Updating Xcode is usually a workflow YAML/runner-image change plus a validation
build, not a `package.json` edit. Pinning the runner (the current workflows use
`macos-26` and explicitly select Xcode 26.6) avoids surprise upgrades, but requires a
deliberate update when GitHub retires that image. Expo SDK 58 needs Xcode 26.6 or
later: with Xcode 26.2, its `ExpoModulesJSI` framework fails to compile. The iOS PR
preview uses the same Xcode as the signed build, so a toolchain problem shows up on a
release PR before a signed build. The direct workflows keep build
orchestration visible in this repository and avoid another credential boundary.

## Expo 58 Android prebuild

This branch uses the Expo 58 preview SDK and its matching stable template package.
Generate the Android project with the exact template version used by the build
script:

```sh
source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
nvm use 24
npm install --force
npx expo prebuild \
  --template expo-template-bare-minimum@58.0.9 \
  --platform android
```

The direct-native script intentionally regenerates the ignored Android project
from this template. Do not hand-edit `android/`; put durable changes in
`app.json` or a config plugin. A manual prebuild can use:

```sh
npx expo prebuild \
  --template expo-template-bare-minimum@58.0.9 \
  --platform android \
  --no-install
```

Then use `npm run build:android`, `npm run build:android:apk`, or
`npm run build:android:apk:debug`; those scripts run the prebuild automatically.

If the Expo 58 preview version changes, update the template version in this section
to the matching template before regenerating native files.

## Building an independent fork

The checked-in configuration points to the church's package and bundle identifiers
and its public app assets. A third party must not use the church's signing or store
credentials. Choose identifiers owned by the fork, create its own Apple Developer
and Google Play accounts if it intends to distribute the apps, and create its own
GitHub Environment secrets. The direct-native workflow architecture can be reused,
but signing material and account access must remain separate.

## If the organization loses access to Apple, Google, or D&B

Treat these accounts as organizational assets, not as one employee's personal
accounts. Keep at least two authorized administrators, use organization-owned
email addresses, store recovery methods securely, and record the legal entity
name, address, EIN, D-U-N-S number, account IDs, and renewal dates.

### Apple Developer

The critical Apple role is called **Account Holder**. For an organization
membership, the Account Holder must have legal authority to bind the
organization. If the current Account Holder is still reachable, they can add
the successor to the team and transfer the role from Apple Developer's
[Transfer the Account Holder role](https://developer.apple.com/help/account/access/transfer-the-account-holder-role/)
page. The successor needs an Apple Account with two-factor authentication and
may need identity verification and to accept the transferee agreement.

If the Account Holder is deceased, unreachable, or the organization cannot
sign in, contact [Apple Developer Support](https://developer.apple.com/contact/)
and explain that the organization has lost its Account Holder. Be prepared to
show the successor's government ID and evidence that they are authorized to
bind the legal entity, such as board authorization, corporate or nonprofit
registration, an officer/director listing, and the organization's official
contact information. Apple determines the exact documents and may request
additional business records; do not assume an Admin can replace the Account
Holder without Apple's help.

Apple's organization enrollment and identity record must match the legal
entity. A nonprofit should be enrolled as the nonprofit's organization, with
the nonprofit's legal name, address, and D-U-N-S record—not as a sole
proprietor or individual. See Apple's guidance on
[updating organization information](https://developer.apple.com/help/account/membership/updating-your-account-information).

### Google Play Console

For Google Play, use an **Organization** developer account and an
organization-type Google Payments profile. Google requires a D-U-N-S number
for organization accounts and offers **Non-profit** as an organization type;
do not leave the account as Personal/Individual or Sole Proprietor merely
because that was the default selected during setup. The legal name and address
in Google Payments must match the D&B profile.

If the existing owner is available, add the successor under **Users and
permissions** and use Google's [Transfer ownership of a Play Console
developer account](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/16909862)
process. The current Google guidance includes a seven-day security cooling-off
period. If the owner is no longer reachable, Google says to contact Play
Console support through the Help section or its online form; the self-service
transfer cannot be completed without the current owner. Be ready with the
successor's government ID, organization relationship/authority, verified
contact information, Google Payments access, and nonprofit/legal-entity
documents requested by Google. See Google's [required account
information](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/13628312)
and [identity/profile update guidance](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/13634888).

If recovery is impossible, create a new organization Play Console account and
ask Google to transfer the apps. This is a recovery path, not a shortcut: the
new account must be active and verified, and app signing, Firebase, API,
analytics, payments, testing, and reports may need follow-up work.

### D-U-N-S and Dun & Bradstreet recovery

The relevant D&B product name is **D-U-N-S Profile Manager** (often shortened
to D-U-N-S Manager), not “DNB business profile manager.” Use the official
[D-U-N-S Profile Manager](https://www.dnb.com/en-us/smb/duns/duns-manager.html),
[D&B company-profile manager](https://smallbusiness.dnb.com/duns-manager/company-profile),
or [D&B sign-in](https://my.dnb.com/) entry points. D&B describes verified
owners, directors, or officers as the people who can manage the profile.

If the organization has no D-U-N-S number, request one through D&B's
[D-U-N-S request service](https://www.dnb.com/duns-number/get-a-duns.html)
and keep the confirmation. The practical wait we experienced was roughly
**5–10 business days** for a new number; this is an operational estimate, not
a guaranteed SLA. Apple and Google may also need additional time after D&B
updates before their verification systems see the change.

If the existing D&B profile is controlled by a departed contact, use Profile
Manager's verification/recovery flow and request access as an authorized
owner, director, or officer. Prepare the organization's exact legal name and
address, D-U-N-S number, government-issued ID, work email/phone, and documents
showing authority—typically formation/registration records, IRS EIN or
tax-exempt determination documentation, nonprofit registration, and a board
resolution or letter of authorization. D&B may request different or additional
documents, so submit only what its support team asks for.

In our experience, becoming the verified D-U-N-S profile manager took another
roughly **5–10 business days**. The role we were looking for is best described
as a verified owner/director/officer in D-U-N-S Profile Manager; D&B's exact
label may vary by region and workflow.

Most importantly, check the D&B legal-entity classification after recovery.
For a nonprofit, the profile must identify the actual nonprofit legal entity,
not Sole Proprietorship. A D-U-N-S request can default to an individual/sole-
proprietor-style record even when the applicant selected nonprofit. Correct the
D&B record first, using the nonprofit's legal documents, then wait for the
change to propagate before submitting Apple or Google verification. Google
explicitly says organization name, address, and D-U-N-S updates originate in
D&B rather than being edited directly in Play Console.

## One-time account setup

The account steps below describe the store accounts and the direct-native workflows.
Neither recommended workflow requires an Expo account; follow [Android setup](#android-setup-github-hosted-direct-builds) and
[iOS setup](#ios-setup-github-hosted-direct-builds) for their build credentials.

### Apple Developer versus Apple Business Manager

Apple Business Manager is **not required** to enroll in or use the Apple
Developer Program for App Store distribution. They are separate Apple
services. The required service for this project is an Apple Developer Program
organization membership; Apple requires the legal entity, D-U-N-S number,
legal binding authority, a work email, and a public organization website
([Apple's enrollment requirements](https://developer.apple.com/help/account/membership/program-enrollment/)).

Do not assume that an Apple Business Manager login is the Apple Developer
login. If the organization already uses Apple Business Manager, it can be
useful for device management, Managed Apple Accounts, and distributing custom
apps, but it does not replace Apple Developer enrollment. Apple describes the
relationship in its [membership comparison](https://developer.apple.com/support/compare-memberships/):
apps distributed through the App Store, Apple Business Manager, or Apple School
Manager use the Apple Developer Program.

For a small organization, the practical setup is an organization-controlled
Apple Account with two-factor authentication used to enroll the Apple Developer
Program organization membership. Then add at least one additional trusted
Admin and keep recovery methods under organizational control. The enrolling
person becomes the Apple Developer **Account Holder**, which is the role that
renews membership and accepts legal agreements. If the organization uses
Managed Apple Accounts through Apple Business Manager, Apple says Account
Holder-role changes may require contacting Apple, so document the relationship
and do not make the account dependent on one employee's personal Apple Account.

1. Install dependencies with `npm ci --force`. Expo 58 preview currently pairs a
   React Native release candidate with peer ranges that exclude prereleases; remove
   `--force` when the SDK publishes a stable React Native dependency graph. Use Node
   22 for parity with native CI.
2. Confirm `org.nyccsda.app` is the intended identifier in both stores. Configure
   the organization's Apple Developer/App Store Connect and Google Play accounts.
3. Decide the credential source before the first store build. This project uses
   GitHub-hosted Android credentials for direct Gradle builds and GitHub-hosted
   Apple credentials for direct Xcode builds. Keep an encrypted offline backup and
   credential recovery under church ownership.

## GitHub-hosted signing and submission credentials

GitHub-hosted credentials are the configuration for the direct-native Android and
iOS paths. Android uses environment variables in its config plugin. The direct iOS
workflow restores an Apple `.p12` and provisioning profile into temporary files,
imports the certificate into an ephemeral keychain, and uses Xcode's manual signing
settings. It does not create a credentials file or send signing material to another
build service.

The direct-native GitHub workflows store the keystore, `.p12`, and provisioning
profile as encrypted Environment secrets (usually base64-encoded), recreate them
in the runner's temporary directory, and delete them afterward. The iOS workflow
also deletes its temporary keychain and installed provisioning profile. Base64 is
only an encoding for binary files; the GitHub secret is the protection. Never echo
either the encoded or decoded value.

The current Android workflow needs only these four production Environment secrets:
`ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64`, `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS`, and
`ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD`. `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PATH` is deliberately not a stored
secret: the workflow creates the keystore at a fresh runner-temporary path and
passes that derived path to the build script. `EXPO_TOKEN` is not read by any
recommended workflow and should be removed after the PR that removes EAS support
has merged.

Use separate secrets rather than one large structured secret where practical:

```text
ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64
ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD
ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS
ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD
IOS_DISTRIBUTION_CERTIFICATE_BASE64
IOS_DISTRIBUTION_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD
IOS_PROVISIONING_PROFILE_BASE64
IOS_TEAM_ID
```

The store-upload credentials are kept apart from these, in a separate `store-upload`
Environment used only by the upload jobs:

```text
APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_ID
APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_ISSUER_ID
APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_PRIVATE_KEY
GOOGLE_PLAY_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_PROVIDER
GOOGLE_PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT
```

The two Google Play values aren't keys: the upload signs in without one.

See [Automatic store uploads](#automatic-store-uploads).

The production secret Environment should require reviewer approval, be
available only to protected `main` builds or deliberate manual dispatches from
`main`, and use
read-only repository permissions for the build job. Keep third-party Actions
pinned and review workflow changes before approving a signing run. The current
main-only guard is necessary but is not a substitute for these controls.

## iOS setup: GitHub-hosted direct builds

The separate `.github/workflows/native-ios-build.yml` workflow runs only on trusted
pushes to `main` or a manual dispatch from `main`. It has no pull-request or
`release/**` signing path and does not receive `EXPO_TOKEN`. It creates an IPA
artifact, which a separate job then uploads to TestFlight; see
[Automatic store uploads](#automatic-store-uploads).

Before running it, configure these secrets in the protected `production`
Environment in the upstream repository. Creating the certificate and profile in the
Apple Developer portal, encoding them on Windows, and renewing them each year are
covered in [App Store and Google Play setup](app-store-setup.md#apple-app-store):

```text
IOS_DISTRIBUTION_CERTIFICATE_BASE64
IOS_DISTRIBUTION_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD
IOS_PROVISIONING_PROFILE_BASE64
IOS_TEAM_ID
```

`IOS_DISTRIBUTION_CERTIFICATE_BASE64` is a base64 encoding of a `.p12` that
contains the Apple Distribution certificate and its private key. The password is
the export password for that `.p12`. `IOS_PROVISIONING_PROFILE_BASE64` is a
base64 encoding of an App Store distribution provisioning profile for exactly
`org.nyccsda.app`. `IOS_TEAM_ID` is the church's Apple Developer Team ID. The
workflow validates the profile's team and application identifier before importing
anything into the temporary keychain.

On macOS, encode binary files without printing their contents to the terminal:

```sh
base64 -i /secure/location/nyccsda-distribution.p12 | tr -d '\n' | pbcopy
# Paste into IOS_DISTRIBUTION_CERTIFICATE_BASE64 in GitHub

base64 -i /secure/location/nyccsda-app-store.mobileprovision | tr -d '\n' | pbcopy
# Paste into IOS_PROVISIONING_PROFILE_BASE64 in GitHub
```

The workflow performs all of the following on the runner: installs dependencies,
generates the ignored iOS project with Expo prebuild, installs CocoaPods,
creates an ephemeral keychain, imports the `.p12`, installs the provisioning
profile, archives with Xcode, exports an App Store IPA, uploads only the IPA, and
deletes the certificate, profile, keychain, archive, and export files in an
`always()` cleanup step.

The iOS build number is computed from the version in `app.json` (`0.40.0` becomes
`40000`) and passed to Xcode, for pushes and manual runs alike; see
[Version numbers](version-numbers.md). The workflow refuses to run if `app.json` sets
`expo.ios.buildNumber` by hand.

The build job has no App Store Connect API key. The separate **Upload to TestFlight**
job, in the `store-upload` Environment, uploads the IPA; see
[Automatic store uploads](#automatic-store-uploads).

## Android setup: GitHub-hosted direct builds

Complete these steps in order. The repository changes are ready, but the first
Android store build should not be run until the exact Play version code and
upload-key situation are confirmed.

### 1. Identify the key Google Play expects

Open Play Console → **Test and release → Setup → App integrity** and inspect
**App signing** and **Upload key certificate**.

- If this app has already had an AAB uploaded, keep using the matching upload
  private key. A newly generated key will not sign updates unless Google resets
  the upload key for the app.
- The Play Console's app-signing private key is held by Google and is not
  something to download; CI needs only the upload key. If an existing upload key
  was generated elsewhere, recover it from the church's encrypted backup rather
  than creating a replacement.
- If no release has ever been uploaded and there is no existing upload key,
  generate a new one as described below.
- If the current upload key is lost or compromised, use Play Console's upload
  key reset process. Do not silently create a second keystore and hope that
  Play accepts it.

### 2. Generate an upload key only when needed

Run this outside the repository, on an organization-controlled computer. Replace
the placeholder path with a protected location. Do not commit the `.jks` file.

```sh
umask 077
keytool -genkeypair -v \
  -storetype JKS \
  -keystore /path/outside/repo/nyccsda-upload.jks \
  -alias nyccsda-upload \
  -keyalg RSA \
  -keysize 2048 \
  -validity 10000

keytool -list -v \
  -keystore /path/outside/repo/nyccsda-upload.jks \
  -alias nyccsda-upload
```

Use a unique, long password for both the keystore and private key unless the
church's existing key uses different values. Save the file, alias, and
passwords in an encrypted organization password manager and in a separate
encrypted offline backup. The `.jks` is an upload key, not the Play app-signing
key. The `10000`-day validity is deliberate: Android upload keys do not need
annual rotation and should normally remain stable for the life of the app.

### 3. The Play version code

The `versionCode` must increase with every Google Play upload. `app.config.js`
computes it from the version (`0.40.0` becomes `40000`), so nobody sets it by hand,
and the build script refuses to run if `app.json` sets one. See
[Version numbers](version-numbers.md).

### 4. Configure the protected GitHub Environment

In the church's **upstream** GitHub repository, open **Settings → Environments**
and create or select `production`. Require at least one reviewer, restrict the
deployment branch to the church's trusted `main` branch, and add
these Environment secrets:

```text
ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64       # base64 of the JKS file
ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD
ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS              # e.g. nyccsda-upload
ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD
```

Use the Environment secret form—not **Repository secrets**—for these values.
Environment approval is the release gate that keeps a maintainer in the loop
before a job can use production signing material. If duplicate values currently
exist under Repository secrets, add the values to `production`, verify the
protected workflow uses that Environment, then delete the repository-level copies.

Create the base64 value locally and paste it into the secret without printing
the keystore or password. On macOS, for example:

```sh
base64 -i /path/outside/repo/nyccsda-upload.jks | tr -d '\n' | pbcopy
```

On Linux, use `base64 -w 0 /path/outside/repo/nyccsda-upload.jks` and paste the
output directly into GitHub. The workflow's `environment: production` setting
and main-only guard ensure that a pull request cannot read these values.
Review the workflow file before approving a protected run; anyone who can
change a trusted workflow and access its approval can potentially use its
secrets.

### 5. Build and verify before uploading

For ordinary local smoke testing, use the debug-signed APK. It does not need
the production upload keystore or any signing secrets:

```sh
npm ci --force
npm run build:android:apk:debug -- --output /tmp/nyccsda-local-preview.apk
```

The debug APK is suitable for installing on a test device, but it must never
be uploaded to Google Play. A truly unsigned APK is generally not installable.

Only a maintainer on a trusted machine should create a locally signed release
artifact. If that is necessary, set the four signing variables only in the
current terminal session. `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PATH` points to the real JKS file;
the other values are the values recorded in the password manager:

```sh
export ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PATH=/path/outside/repo/nyccsda-upload.jks
export ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD='paste-only-in-your-terminal'
export ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS='nyccsda-upload'
export ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD='paste-only-in-your-terminal'

npm ci --force
npm run build:android:apk -- --output /tmp/nyccsda-preview.apk
npm run build:android -- --output /tmp/nyccsda-release.aab

unset ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PATH ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD
```

Both paths regenerate the ignored Android project with Expo prebuild, apply the
committed signing plugin, invoke Gradle, and copy the result to the requested
path. The signed path refuses to build without complete signing values, or with a
hand-set `versionCode` in `app.json`. The signed APK is useful for physical-device testing;
the AAB is what goes to Google Play.

Verify the artifact locally before uploading:

```sh
jarsigner -verify -verbose -certs /tmp/nyccsda-release.aab
```

Google requires the app's **first** upload to be made by hand in Play Console; the
church did this with 0.39.0. Every release since uploads its AAB to internal testing
automatically; see [Automatic store uploads](#automatic-store-uploads). Install each
one from the Play Store on a real phone, and check that it updates over the previous
build.

### Android rotation and recovery policy

There is no annual Android upload-certificate expiration requirement. Keep the
same upload keystore indefinitely, rotate it only for a compromise, loss of
organizational control, or a deliberate security policy, and retain two
independent encrypted backups. If it must change, initiate the Google Play
upload-key reset and wait for Play to confirm the new certificate before using
the replacement in GitHub.

The automatic Google Play upload doesn't use the upload keystore to sign in. It signs
in as the `play-upload` service account **without a key**, so there's no second
credential to back up or rotate; see
[Setting up the Google Play service account](#setting-up-the-google-play-service-account).
When an administrator leaves, remove them as an Owner of the Google Cloud project and
from Play Console.

## External account cleanup

The repository no longer contains EAS commands, EAS project metadata, or EAS
workflow configuration. Before deleting any external Expo account, confirm that
the church does not need its project history, exported credentials, or records.
Account deletion is separate from this repository change and is not performed
automatically.

This credential plan does not eliminate maintenance: protect the Android upload
keystore and keep an encrypted organizational backup; renew Apple distribution
certificates and provisioning profiles; revoke and replace compromised tokens;
and rotate the Google/Apple submission credentials when staff or access changes.
Apple provisioning profiles expire after 12 months, while Google Play can reset a
lost or compromised upload key. See [Google Play App Signing](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9842756?hl=en).

## Build commands

### Android direct-native commands

The Android scripts regenerate the ignored native project with Expo prebuild, apply
`plugins/withAndroidLocalSigning.js`, and invoke Gradle directly. Signed release
commands require the four `ANDROID_*` variables; the local preview command does not:

```sh
npm run build:android:apk -- --output /absolute/path/app.apk
npm run build:android -- --output /absolute/path/app.aab
npm run build:android:apk:debug -- --output /absolute/path/local-preview.apk
```

The signed commands require the four `ANDROID_*` signing environment variables; see
[Android setup](#android-setup-github-hosted-direct-builds).
The debug command uses Gradle's automatically generated debug key and does not require
or touch the production upload keystore. It creates a standalone APK for local device
testing and must never be uploaded to Google Play. A truly unsigned APK is generally
not installable.

The signed APK is for direct installation/testing, and the AAB is the Google Play artifact.

| Target | Recommended build path |
| --- | --- |
| iOS IPA (TestFlight/App Store) | **Native iOS build** workflow |
| Android AAB (Google Play) | `npm run build:android` |
| Android APK (direct installation) | `npm run build:android:apk` |
| Android APK (local debug key) | `npm run build:android:apk:debug` |

The direct Android commands output a binary on this computer; append
`--output /absolute/path/app.aab` or `.apk` to choose its destination. The
preview APK is standalone and does not require Metro. The direct iOS workflow
uses the App Store distribution profile and a build number computed from the version;
internal iOS distribution is not TestFlight.

Local iOS builds require macOS, Xcode with command-line tools, and CocoaPods. Local Android builds require macOS or Linux, Java 17, Android SDK/NDK
and accepted SDK licenses; install Android Studio and the SDK tooling required by
the Expo 58 preview dependency set. Configure `ANDROID_HOME` and the Android
command-line tools on PATH.
Direct Android and iOS compilation require network access for npm dependencies,
the Expo template, and CocoaPods, but not Expo authentication. They are not
offline build paths. Build one platform at a time.

In GitHub Actions, select **Native Android build → Run workflow** for an Android AAB
or APK. Select **Native iOS build → Run workflow** for an iOS IPA; its build number
is computed from the version. These workflows
become available in the Actions UI after they reach the default branch. Android compiles
directly with Gradle on Ubuntu 24.04 / Java 17; iOS compiles directly with Xcode
on macOS 26 / Xcode 26.6. Download the signed binaries from the run's Artifacts
section (14-day retention). Neither recommended workflow requires Expo
authentication.
GitHub compilation uses GitHub runner minutes/storage.
No selection performs no builds. Native failures do not block the web/PWA preview
deployment.

### iOS PR preview (unsigned Simulator builds)

The iOS counterpart of the Android PR preview. A Simulator build runs the app on a
simulated iPhone on a Mac. It needs no Apple
signing, certificate, developer account, or iPhone, but it can't be installed on a
real iPhone; use the signed **Native iOS build** and TestFlight for that. Only GitHub
Actions and a local Mac are used; no other build service.

**On a Mac.** Install Xcode 26.6 or later and CocoaPods, then:

```sh
npm install --force
npm run build:ios:simulator                          # Release build, JavaScript bundled in
npm run build:ios:simulator -- --debug               # Debug build that loads JavaScript from Metro
npm run build:ios:simulator -- --device "iPhone 17"  # Choose the simulated iPhone
npm run build:ios:simulator -- --prebuild            # Regenerate ios/ after native config changes
```

`scripts/build-ios-simulator.mjs` generates the ignored `ios/` project with the same
Expo template as the other native builds (a test keeps the versions in step). It then
runs `expo run:ios`, which installs CocoaPods, builds, installs the app on the
Simulator, and opens it. Xcode builds for the Mac's own processor, so the same command
works on Intel and Apple Silicon Macs. On Windows or Linux, the command explains that it
needs a Mac.

**In GitHub Actions.** The **iOS PR preview** workflow (`ios-pr-preview.yml`) builds
each release PR into `main` without signing. It runs on an Apple
Silicon runner (`macos-26`, arm64) and an Intel runner (`macos-26-intel`, x86_64), with
the same Xcode as the signed iOS build. Each job installs the app on the simulated
iPhone that `test/screens/screens.json` names (an iPhone 17 Pro Max, on the newest iOS
runtime) and fails if it isn't still running 45 seconds after launch. Each also uploads the app
and a screenshot of its first screen (14-day retention), named like the Android
preview's `sda-church-app-pr-<number>-<run>-arm-debug.apk`:

- `sda-church-app-pr-<number>-<run>-arm64-simulator.zip` and `…-x86_64-simulator.zip`:
  the app;
- `sda-church-app-pr-<number>-<run>-<arch>-first-screen.png`: the screenshot;
- `screens/ios/<screen>-<variant>.png`, in the Apple Silicon artifact only: the key
  screens, described below.

Pull requests into a `release/*` branch don't run it, and neither do other pull
requests into `main`, such as Dependabot's. To test a change to the workflow,
`scripts/build-ios-simulator.mjs`, or the key screens before the release PR, start it by
hand on your branch from the Actions tab. The workflow reads no secrets, so it is safe on pull requests.

**Key screens.** The Apple Silicon job also screenshots the screens listed in
`test/screens/screens.json`, so a layout problem on iPhone shows up before release
rather than in TestFlight (#331). `scripts/capture-ios-screens.cjs` takes each one:

1. It saves the settings the app reads at startup into the app's storage: setup
   finished, and the language, theme, and text size for that shot. The first-launch
   setup dialog can't be tapped away in the Simulator, so this is how it's skipped.
   Shots with the same settings share one launch, which keeps the run to a few minutes.
2. It opens the screen by deep link (`sdachurchapp://<path>`), waits for it to load,
   and saves `screens/ios/<screen>-<variant>.png`.
3. The status bar is fixed (9:41, full battery and signal), so images differ only when
   the app does. Each image is the whole rectangular screen, with no rounded corners or
   Dynamic Island cutout.

Variants cover dark mode, 150% and 200% app text, the iPhone's own largest text sizes,
and the Chinese and Spanish interfaces. Some screens reproduce bugs fixed before:
Psalm 119's three-digit verse numbers at 200%, a chapter opened at verse 14 so text sits
under the status bar, and the Bible header with two translations and a back arrow.

**Automatic checks.** The run fails, and the step summary says why, if the app isn't
running after a deep link, if a screenshot is blank, or if a screen marked
`statusBarClear` shows anything behind the status bar.

**Human review.** Other layout problems, such as a cut-off label or a verse number
split across two lines, need a person. On the release pull request into `main`,
download the Apple Silicon run's artifact and look through `screens/ios/`, then add the
**screenshots reviewed** label. The **Screenshots reviewed** check
(`screenshot-review.yml`) fails until the label is there, and a new push removes it, so
each version of the release gets its own review.

**App Store screenshots.** The images are 1320 × 2868, the App Store's 6.9-inch iPhone
size. The shots listed under `appStore` in the screen list are also copied, numbered in
upload order, to `screens/app-store/<language>/`, ready to upload; see
[Store assets](../store-assets/README.md). The Home screen's verse of the day and
countdown change daily, which its `changesDaily` entry marks for when these images are
compared with known-good copies.

To add a screen, add an entry to `test/screens/screens.json`: a `name`, the deep link
`path` without the scheme, any Bible `settings`, the `variants` to take, and any
`checks`. Leave out screens that show members' names or photos, such as the bulletin,
the team page, and the fellowship page; `test/screens.test.ts` checks this. A new
setting also needs its storage key in the script's `SETTING_KEYS`, and the test checks
the app still reads that key.

**Install a downloaded build on a Mac.** From the run's Artifacts section, download the
artifact ending in `-x86_64` for an Intel Mac or `-arm64` for Apple Silicon, and unzip
the download and then the `.zip` inside it to get the `.app`. Open the Simulator
(Xcode > Open Developer Tool > Simulator) and drag the `.app` onto the simulated
iPhone, or run:

```sh
xcrun simctl install booted /path/to/the.app
xcrun simctl launch booted org.nyccsda.app
```

## Automatic store uploads

After you approve a release's signed builds, two more jobs upload them to testers
automatically, with no further clicks:

- **Upload to TestFlight**, in **Native iOS build**, uploads the IPA to App Store
  Connect. It appears in TestFlight once Apple finishes processing it, usually within
  half an hour, and an internal group with automatic distribution gets it.
- **Upload to Google Play internal testing**, in **Native Android build**, signs in
  through the church's [Google Cloud project](../architecture.md#google-cloud-free-only)
  without a key, uploads the AAB, and rolls it out to the internal testing track. Its
  "What's new" text is the
  release PR's title without the `Release/x.y.z:` prefix: `Release/0.40.0: Faster
  bulletin (#300)` becomes "Faster bulletin". A title with nothing after the version
  gives no notes.

Nothing reaches the public automatically. After testing on real devices, a maintainer
submits the iOS build for review from App Store Connect's **Distribution** page, and
promotes the Android release to production in Play Console. **Promoting copies the
testers' "What's new" text,** so rewrite it for the public before rolling out.
TestFlight builds have no "What to Test" text; add one in App Store Connect if
testers need it.

### How the credentials are kept apart

- The store credentials live in their own `store-upload` Environment. The build jobs,
  which hold the signing keys, never see them. Google Play needs no stored key at all:
  GitHub vouches for the upload job, and Google returns a token that expires within an
  hour (see [Setting up the Google Play service account](#setting-up-the-google-play-service-account)).
- The upload jobs never see the signing keys. They download the finished file and
  upload it without running any npm packages: iOS uses Apple's `altool`, and Android
  uses `scripts/upload-google-play.cjs`, which needs only Node's built-ins. So a
  compromised dependency in a build job can't reach the store credentials.
- Both run only for `main` in the church's repository, and skip with a notice until
  their secrets are set.

Why a separate environment instead of `production`:

- **`production` is shared.** The signed builds, the Apps Script deploy, the QR code
  upload, and the Android PR preview's Drive upload all use it, and the preview runs
  for pull requests. Any job that names an environment can read every secret in it.
  In `store-upload`, only the two upload jobs can reach the store credentials.
- **One approval instead of two.** `production` requires a reviewer for every job.
  The upload jobs start after the builds finish, so in `production` each release would
  ask for a second approval. `store-upload` has no reviewer, so approving the builds
  is the only click, and the uploads reach only testers.
- **Separate control.** Uploads can be paused, for example by adding a reviewer or
  removing a secret, without touching signing or the other deploys.

### One-time setup

1. **The environment:** Settings → Environments → **New environment** → `store-upload`.
   Under **Deployment branches and tags**, allow only `main`. It doesn't need required
   reviewers: approving the signed builds already gates the uploads, which reach only
   testers.
2. **App Store Connect:**
   1. The Account Holder requests API access under **Users and Access → Integrations
      → App Store Connect API**. Its terms limit the API to a team's own internal
      development and testing, which uploading the church's builds to TestFlight is.
   2. Generate a **Team key** with the **Developer** role, the smallest role that can
      upload builds. Download its `.p8` file right away (Apple allows it only once),
      and keep it with the other signing files.
   3. Add these secrets to `store-upload`:
      - `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_ID`: the key's ID.
      - `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_ISSUER_ID`: the issuer ID shown above the list of keys.
      - `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_PRIVATE_KEY`: the whole `.p8` file, including its
        `BEGIN` and `END` lines.
   4. Create an internal testing group, so each new build reaches its testers: App
      Store Connect → **Apps** → the app → **TestFlight** → **Internal Testing** in
      the sidebar → **+**. Name it, such as `Church testers`, tick **Enable automatic
      distribution**, and click **Create**. Then add testers under **Testers → +**. Only
      users on the App Store Connect team can be internal testers (up to 100); invite
      anyone else under **Users and Access** first. Each tester gets an email and
      installs the build with Apple's **TestFlight** app on their iPhone.
3. **Google Play:** Play accepts uploads through its API only after the app's first
   upload is made by hand in Play Console. After that, follow
   [Setting up the Google Play service account](#setting-up-the-google-play-service-account).

### Setting up the Google Play service account

Google's upload API accepts only a *service account*: a robot Google account kept in a
Google Cloud project. GitHub signs in as it **without any key**: it vouches that the
job runs in the church's repository, in the `store-upload` environment on `main`, and
Google returns a token that expires within an hour. This is called *Workload Identity
Federation*. There's nothing to store, leak, or renew, and it's a one-time setup;
every release after that signs in on its own. **It costs nothing and needs no billing
account.**

Why not a key file: the church's Google organization blocks service account keys with
Google's *Secure by Default* policy, `iam.managed.disableServiceAccountKeyCreation`. A
super admin could turn it off for this project, but a key file never expires and can
leak, so the church kept the policy on and uses keyless sign-in instead. The
[Google Play upload sign-in diagram](../architecture.md#google-play-upload-sign-in)
shows each step.
[Service limits and costs](service-limits-and-costs.md#google-cloud-play-upload-service-account)
records why, and the rules that keep it free.

**Create the project**

1. Open [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com) and sign in with
   a church (`nyccsda.org`) admin account. On a first visit, choose the country, accept
   the terms, and continue.
   - If Google offers a **free trial**, or asks you to **activate** an account with a
     card, dismiss it. That creates a billing account, which this project must never
     have.
   - If the console says your account can't use Google Cloud, a Workspace admin turns
     it on under **Admin console → Apps → Additional Google services → Google Cloud**.
2. Click the project picker at the top of the page (it says **Select a project**),
   then **New project**.
3. Name it `sda-church-app-play`. If that ID is taken, Google suggests one with
   numbers added, which is fine. If **Location** offers `nyccsda.org`, choose it; if it
   offers only **No organization**, leave that, since the project works the same
   either way. It shouldn't ask for a billing account. Click **Create**.
4. When it's ready, choose it in the project picker. Every step below happens inside
   it.
5. So the project doesn't depend on one person, open **IAM & Admin → IAM → Grant
   access** and add the other administrators' church accounts with the **Owner**
   role.

**Turn on the APIs**

6. Menu (☰) → **APIs & Services → Library**. Search for each of these, open it, and
   click **Enable**. None of them asks for billing; if one does, stop.
   - **Google Play Android Developer API**
   - **IAM Service Account Credentials API**
   - **Security Token Service API**
   - **Identity and Access Management (IAM) API**
   - **Cloud Resource Manager API**

**Create the service account**

7. Menu → **IAM & Admin → Service Accounts → Create service account**. Name it
   `play-upload` and click **Create and continue**. Skip the two optional steps
   (**Continue**, then **Done**); it needs no Google Cloud roles. Don't create a key
   for it: the upload doesn't need one, and the organization blocks it. Trying shows
   *"An Organization Policy that blocks service accounts key creation has been
   enforced on your organization"*, which is expected.
8. Copy the account's email address, which looks like
   `play-upload@sda-church-app-play.iam.gserviceaccount.com`.

**Let GitHub sign in as it, without a key**

9. Find the repository's numeric ID: open
   `https://api.github.com/repos/New-York-Chinese-Seventh-day-Adventist/sda-church-app`
   in a browser and note the `"id"` near the top. Google recommends the number
   because, unlike a name, no other repository can ever take it over. It only goes
   into Google Cloud; don't commit it.
10. Menu → **IAM & Admin → Workload Identity Federation → Create pool** (or **Get
    started**).
    - **Name:** `GitHub`. **Pool ID:** `github`. Continue.
    - **Add a provider to pool:** choose **OpenID Connect (OIDC)**. **Provider name**
      and **Provider ID:** `sda-church-app`. **Issuer (URL):**
      `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`. **Audiences:** leave **Default
      audience**. Continue.
    - **Configure provider attributes:** set `google.subject` to `assertion.sub`, then
      **Add mapping** for `attribute.repository_id` = `assertion.repository_id`. The
      mapping copies the repository ID out of GitHub's token so that step 11 can match
      on it.
    - **Attribute conditions → Add condition**, with the repository ID from step 9 in
      place of `REPO_ID`:

      ```text
      assertion.repository_id == 'REPO_ID' && assertion.environment == 'store-upload' && assertion.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
      ```

      This is the lock: Google accepts only jobs in this repository's `store-upload`
      environment, on `main`.
    - Click **Save**.
11. On the pool's page, click **Grant access → Grant access using service account
    impersonation**. Choose `play-upload`. Under **Select principals**, choose **Only
    identities matching the filter**, attribute `repository_id`, and the repository ID
    as the value. Click **Save**, and close the **Configure your application** window
    that follows; you don't need its file. This gives identities from this repository
    the **Workload Identity User** role (`roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser`) on
    `play-upload`: permission to get tokens as it, and nothing else.
    - To check, open the pool's **Connected service accounts** tab. It should list
      `play-upload`; expand it to see `attribute.repository_id="<the ID>"`. Ignore
      the **Download** buttons there; nothing needs those files.
    - If Google refuses because an organization policy limits who can be granted
      access, a super admin allows this project's workload identity pool in that
      policy.
12. Copy the provider's name. Open the `sda-church-app` provider: its **Default
    audience** looks like
    `https://iam.googleapis.com/projects/123456789/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/github/providers/sda-church-app`.
    Copy it as it is; the upload drops the `https://iam.googleapis.com/` part.

**Let it upload in Play Console**

13. In Play Console, **Users and permissions** is on the developer account's page,
    not in the app's menu: click **← All apps** at the top left, then **Users and
    permissions → Invite new users**. Paste the email address from step 8. On the
    **App permissions** tab, **Add app**, choose the church app, and tick only
    **Release apps to testing tracks**. That's the permission's name; the app doesn't
    need any testing tracks yet. Click **Invite user**; a service account doesn't
    need to accept.
14. New permissions can take up to a day to reach the API. If the first automatic
    upload fails with a permission error, rerun it later.

**Give GitHub the two settings**

15. Settings → Environments → `store-upload` → **Add environment secret**, twice:
    - `GOOGLE_PLAY_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_PROVIDER`: the provider name from step 12.
    - `GOOGLE_PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`: the email address from step 8.

    Neither is a key. They're secrets only so that the logs of this public repository
    don't show the project number.

**Check the setup**

Everything below should be true before the first automatic upload:

- [ ] Google Cloud → **Billing**: the project has no billing account, and no free trial
      was started.
- [ ] **APIs & Services → Enabled APIs & services** lists the five APIs from step 6.
      Google also turns on others, such as BigQuery and Cloud Storage, for every new
      project. Without a billing account they can't cost anything, so leave them.
- [ ] **IAM & Admin → IAM** lists every IT administrator as **Owner**.
- [ ] **Workload Identity Federation → github**: the `sda-church-app` provider shows a
      green status, and **Connected service accounts** lists `play-upload`.
- [ ] Play Console → **Users and permissions** lists `play-upload@…` as **Active**,
      with **Release apps to testing tracks** on the app.
- [ ] GitHub → Settings → Environments → `store-upload`: deployment branches allow only
      `main`, and the secrets are the three `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_*` values plus
      `GOOGLE_PLAY_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_PROVIDER` and `GOOGLE_PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`.
- [ ] The app's first release has been published by hand to internal testing; see
      [Signing and the first upload](app-store-setup.md#signing-and-the-first-upload).

### Reading the result

| The job reports | What it means | What to do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Uploaded | The build is on its way to testers | Test it |
| A notice that the upload was skipped | The secrets aren't set | Add them to `store-upload` |
| Already on TestFlight, or Google Play already has it | A rerun of the same release; the store has this build number | Nothing |
| Uploaded as a draft | Play accepts only drafts until the app's first release is rolled out | Roll it out in Play Console → **Test and release → Internal testing** |
| Changes need to be sent for review by hand | Play requires that for this app right now | Play Console → **Publishing overview** → send the changes for review |
| Keyless sign-in failed at Google's token exchange | Google refused GitHub's identity token: the provider's condition, the repository ID, or the provider name in `GOOGLE_PLAY_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_PROVIDER` doesn't match | Check steps 9, 10, 12, and 15 of [the service account setup](#setting-up-the-google-play-service-account) |
| Keyless sign-in failed at the service account token | Google accepted GitHub but won't let it act as `play-upload`: the pool isn't connected to the service account, or the IAM Service Account Credentials API is off | Check steps 6 and 11; the pool's **Connected service accounts** tab should list `play-upload` |
| "The caller does not have permission" from Google Play | The service account isn't in Play Console yet, or the permission hasn't reached the API | Check step 13, and rerun after a day |
| Failed | The log has the store's message, often a revoked key or a missing permission | Fix the cause and rerun the job, or upload by hand |

### When Apple rejects a build after uploading

A successful **Upload to TestFlight** job means Apple received the build, not that it
passed. Apple then processes it, usually within 30 minutes. If processing finds a
problem, the build never appears in TestFlight, and Apple emails the Account Holder,
`technology@nyccsda.org`, with the subject "The uploaded build … has one or more
issues" and an `ITMS-` code for each problem.

- **ITMS-90683, missing purpose string:** some code in the app references a protected
  API, such as the photo library, even if the app never calls it. Usually it's a
  library. Find it by searching the dependencies' native code, for example
  `grep -rlE "PHPhotoLibrary|UIImagePickerController" node_modules/<package>/ios`.
  If the app doesn't use the library, remove it. If it does, add the key the email
  names to `expo.ios.infoPlist` in `app.json`, with a sentence that honestly says why.
  (0.40.0 hit this with `react-native-share`, which the app didn't use.)

A rejected build still uses up its build number, so the fix ships as a new version, such
as a patch release; see [Version numbers](version-numbers.md).

### Uploading by hand

If an upload job can't run, download the `.ipa` from the release's GitHub Release (or
the run's artifacts, kept 90 days) and upload it with Apple's Transporter app, or
download the `.aab` from the GitHub Release and upload it in Play Console → **Test and
release → Internal testing → Create new release**. Upload the AAB, not the APK.

## Versions and maintenance

`package.json` / `app.json` retain the shared user-facing release version managed by
`npm run sync-version`. That version should be changed explicitly for each planned
release, and release CI can synchronize it from the release PR title. Both stores'
build numbers are computed from it; see [Version numbers](version-numbers.md).

Keep generated `ios/` and `android/` projects out of Git and express native
configuration through Expo config/plugins. SDK upgrades require checking
Node/Java/Xcode/Android tooling and revalidating physical-device behavior. The app
explicitly pins Android compile API 37, target API 36, and build tools 37.0.0 through
`expo-build-properties`. This split is intentional: the Expo preview's native AARs
require compile API 37, while Google Play currently requires new apps and updates to
target API 36 from August 31, 2026. Android's compile SDK and target SDK are separate;
compiling against API 37 does not opt the app into API 37 runtime behavior. The
workflow installs the versioned `platforms;android-37.0` package, matching the current
runner image, plus build tools and NDK. Revisit this preview-SDK pin when Expo ships a
compatible stable SDK and when the Android platform requirement changes.

Before release, run `npx expo install --check`, `npx expo-doctor`, and `npm run check`.
Then build and test signed binaries on physical iPhone and Android devices,
including the background-audio acceptance checks in
[native-store-investigation.md](native-store-investigation.md). Successful JavaScript
exports alone do not prove native compilation, signing, playback or store acceptance.
OTA updates are not configured by this setup; web/PWA preview deployments do not
update installed native apps.

Local builds are manageable for a maintainer comfortable installing SDK tools.
GitHub’s macOS runner lets you build iOS without
owning a Mac; update the runner/Xcode selection when GitHub retires that version. Both paths still need signing/account maintenance and
periodic store-required SDK updates.

## Research basis

This plan is based on the following primary documentation and the constraints of
this repository:

- [Expo local builds](https://docs.expo.dev/build-reference/local-builds/):
  `eas build --local` runs the compiler on the invoking machine, but still
  authenticates with Expo and can retrieve EAS-managed credentials. This is why
  it avoids EAS Cloud build capacity but does not meet a zero-token requirement.
- [Expo local credentials](https://docs.expo.dev/app-signing/local-credentials/):
  local credentials can be restored from CI secrets and kept out of source
  control. Android direct-native builds go one step further and let Gradle read
  temporary environment-provided signing values without creating
  `credentials.json` at all.
- [Expo Continuous Native Generation](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/continuous-native-generation/)
  and [config plugins](https://docs.expo.dev/config-plugins/introduction/):
  generated native directories can be recreated, so the signing behavior is
  implemented in `plugins/withAndroidLocalSigning.js` rather than an ignored
  hand edit to `android/app/build.gradle`.
- [Expo app credentials](https://docs.expo.dev/app-signing/app-credentials/)
  and [Google Play App Signing](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9842756?hl=en):
  Google protects the Play app-signing key while the developer controls an
  upload key. The upload key must remain stable for updates, can be reset by
  Google after compromise, and does not have an annual expiration requirement.
- [GitHub Actions billing](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/concepts/product-billing/github-actions)
  and [standard runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/runners/github-hosted-runners):
  standard GitHub-hosted runners are currently free for public repositories,
  including standard macOS runners. This supports using GitHub-hosted native
  compilation for this public open-source project, but is a current policy, not
  a guaranteed five-year promise; runner availability, concurrency, and fair-use
  limits still apply.
- [GitHub secret security](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/security/secrets)
  and [secure use](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/security/secure-use):
  secrets are encrypted and are not passed to fork pull requests, but workflow
  code that is allowed to read them can exfiltrate them. This justifies the
  protected Environment, reviewer approval, trusted-branch restrictions, fork
  guard, and reviewed third-party Actions in the workflow.
- [GitHub Actions general availability](https://github.blog/changelog/2019-11-11-github-actions-is-generally-available/):
  the public-repository free standard-runner policy has been part of the Actions
  product since its 2019 general availability. Its history supports treating
  the choice as established infrastructure, while the workflow's direct Gradle
  and Xcode commands keep the project portable if pricing or policy changes.
- [Expo SDK upgrade guidance](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/upgrading-expo-sdk-walkthrough/):
  SDK upgrades remain incremental maintenance. CNG reduces native-file drift,
  but every Expo/React Native, Java, Android SDK/NDK, Xcode, or runner-image
  change still requires a validation build and physical-device checks.

The conclusion is deliberately narrower than “GitHub is safe forever”: GitHub
is currently the lowest-footprint place for this church to hold the Android
upload key, and the direct build is easy to move because it uses standard
Gradle commands. The operational controls and the direct-native design are what
make that choice defensible.
