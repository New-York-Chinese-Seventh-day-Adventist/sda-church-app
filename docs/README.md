# Technical Setup & Testing

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS)
- npm
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17
- For iOS: Xcode (macOS only) supporting iOS 15.0 - 26.3
- For Android: Android Studio, the platform/target SDK required by the current Expo
  canary (currently target API 36 plus compile/build tools 37 on CI), and ANDROID_HOME
  environment
  variable

```bash
npm install
```

[the Constants folder](/constants/).

## Web & PWA Testing and Preview

Native iOS and Android builds are the primary distribution path. The Progressive Web App
(PWA) remains a maintained browser testing and preview surface for UI regression checks,
accessibility testing, demos, and fast fork previews. It is not the canonical release
channel for the church's installed-app users.

The web and native targets continue to share one Expo source tree. A web preview is useful
for testing browser-specific behavior, but passing the web build is not evidence that a
signed iOS or Android binary is ready for store submission.

### Local Development

To start the app in a web browser for local testing (primarily to check for Network tab
404s that prevent PWA from loading on mobile):

```bash
npx expo start --web
```

### Local Web Build and Preview Deployment

The project uses GitHub Pages for hosting. Running the local deploy command builds the web
assets into `dist/` but does not push anything:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

The canonical repository's GitHub workflow publishes the web/PWA preview when `main` is
updated. This deployment is for browser testing, demos, and a quickly accessible fallback;
it does not publish or update the native store applications. The protected publishing mode
refuses to publish from a local shell or a different repository.

To publish a development preview to a fork, opt in explicitly and provide both the fork
repository and its GitHub Pages URL. The URL must use the configured `/sda-church-app`
base path; custom domains are rejected for preview publishing:

```bash
npm run deploy:dev -- \
  --repo git@github.com:CodeSammich/sda-church-app.git \
  --site-url https://codesammich.github.io/sda-church-app/
```

Each fork is deployed under the GitHub Pages domain belonging to that fork's owner. For a
fork that keeps the repository name `sda-church-app`, the URL is:

```text
https://<github-owner>.github.io/sda-church-app/
```

For example, the `CodeSammich` fork is hosted at
`https://codesammich.github.io/sda-church-app/`. A fork owned by another user or
organization must use that owner's `github.io` hostname; it should not assume that the
CodeSammich URL or the NYCCSDA custom domain belongs to it.

Before deploying a fork, update the `homepage` field in `package.json` to its GitHub Pages
URL. When the fork retains the `sda-church-app` repository name, the existing
`/sda-church-app` values in `app.json`, `public/manifest.json`, and the service-worker
registration remain correct. If the repository is renamed, update those base-path,
start-URL, scope, and service-worker-path values to the new repository path as well. A
custom domain is optional and requires its own GitHub Pages and DNS configuration.

For development builds, you may use the increment flag to automatically update the patch
version in `package.json` and prepare a versioned local web build. Please remember to reset
the version number when raising the final pull request.

```bash
npm run deploy -- --increment
```

### Web/PWA update prompt (preview only)

`public/sw.js` is the versioned service worker used to detect application releases. Keep
its `VERSION` synchronized with `package.json` through `public/sync-version.js`; deploying
changed bundles without changing the service worker would not create a new waiting worker
for existing installations to detect.

The update flow is intentionally user-controlled:

1. Service-worker registration and the initial update check run after the application has
   started; they do not block the first render.
2. The app performs the browser equivalent of a no-cache `curl` against the small `sw.js`
   file and compares its deployed `VERSION` with the version embedded in the running app
   bundle. The last automatic check time is persisted in browser local storage, limiting
   automatic checks to once every hour across launches and foreground resumes. This follows
   [web.dev's service-worker lifecycle guidance](https://web.dev/articles/service-worker-lifecycle#manual_updates),
   which recommends an interval such as hourly when an application may remain open for a
   long time; this app applies that interval to launch and foreground-resume events rather
   than running a continuous background polling timer.
3. Pressing the version number in the You screen remains the explicit manual check. It
   checks the service-worker registration and reports “checking,” “up to date,” or an
   available update through the shared localized banner.
4. Pressing the Home tab performs an additional silent, no-cache fetch of only `sw.js`.
   This user-initiated check is not subject to the hourly launch/resume limit. It does not
   show an “up to date” message or download the full application bundle. If the deployed
   version differs, the normal update banner appears and lets the user choose whether to
   install it. Repeated Home presses are ignored while one of these checks is in progress.
5. When a changed worker finishes installing, it remains in the browser's `waiting` state.
   One localized, app-themed banner appears at the top of the app instead of interrupting
   the user or adding update controls to individual pages.
6. Pressing the banner action asks the browser to update its registration, resolves the
   current waiting worker, and sends it `SKIP_WAITING`. Once the worker takes control, the
   app performs a cache-busting navigation so the page shell is retrieved from the CDN.
   The newly loaded bundle repeats the deployed-version comparison and hides the banner
   when both versions match. If Bible audio is active, navigation is deferred until the
   user leaves the Bible reader.

This uses the standard service-worker lifecycle and does not poll application pages or
download the full JavaScript bundle merely to discover whether an update exists.

### Optional PWA installation for testing

- iOS (Safari): Open the preview URL -> Tap the Share button -> Add to Home Screen.
- Android (Chrome): Open the preview URL -> Tap the Three Dots -> Install App or Add to
  Home Screen.

This is a convenient way to test the browser-installed experience. It is not a substitute
for installing a signed native build from TestFlight or Google Play.

Note: If you encounter a black screen on launch, check the browser's Network tab for 404s
or 400s. Any failed asset load will prevent the Expo bundle from initializing.

## Why Keep a PWA Testing Surface?

The PWA is retained as a secondary engineering and preview surface:

1. Fast browser regression testing for layout, accessibility, links, caching, and web-only
   behavior.
2. Easy previews for contributors, maintainers, and church stakeholders before a native
   binary is built.
3. A low-friction demo and fallback surface that does not require store installation.

Native iOS and Android binaries remain the supported primary release targets. Native
signing, device testing, store review, and store submission are documented in the
[native build guide](operations/native-builds.md).
