# English Hymnal Integration: As-Built Design and Link-Safety Record

Last reviewed: 2026-10-02

## 1. Purpose and Current Decision

The English hymnal feature provides a searchable index of the Seventh-day Adventist
Hymnal (1985 Edition) and sends users to externally hosted sheet music. The app does not
host, proxy, cache, or embed the scores.

For a selected hymn, the app opens this form of URL in the system browser. On iOS and
Android that is the system's in-app browser view (`expo-web-browser`: Safari View Controller
on iOS, a Custom Tab on Android). On web it is a separate browser tab.

```text
https://hymnsforworship.org/sdah-214#hymn-score
```

The `#hymn-score` fragment makes the browser scroll directly to the score section. This
removes most of the navigational friction that prompted consideration of raw image links,
while retaining the publisher-facing page, attribution, copyright information, and site
context. If no hymn number is supplied, the app opens the site's 1985 hymnal directory.

Not every hymn page has a score. SDAH 509 points to sheet music elsewhere and has no
`hymn-score` anchor, so its link opens at the top of the hymn page.

This is a risk-reduction decision, not a declaration that the feature is "liability-free"
or that every externally hosted score is licensed for every possible use.

## 2. Source-Site Findings

### 2.1 Operator and provenance

[Hymns for Worship](https://hymnsforworship.org/) is an independent ministry run by an
experienced church musician and music educator, as the site's
[About page](https://hymnsforworship.org/about-us/) describes. Future documentation
should not describe the operator as a college student or imply that the site is operated
by the Seventh-day Adventist denomination.

### 2.2 What the score pages show

The score pages identify authors, composers, and copyright notices for individual hymns.
Examples reviewed on 2026-08-09 include:

- [SDAH 214, "We Have This Hope"](https://hymnsforworship.org/sdah-214-we-have-this-hope/),
  which identifies copyrights held by Wayne Hooper; and
- [SDAH 689, "Day by Day, Dear Lord"](https://hymnsforworship.org/sdah-689-day-day-dear-lord/),
  which states that the music is copyrighted by H.W. Gray Co. and "used by permission."

The corresponding score images say that the notation was prepared by
`hymnsforworship.org` and sourced from the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal, 1985.

The phrase "used by permission" is evidence that some permission exists somewhere in the
work's publication history. It is not, by itself, proof that:

1. the permission was granted directly to Hymns for Worship rather than to the publisher
   of the 1985 hymnal;
2. it covers publication of the score on the web;
3. it authorizes Hymns for Worship to sublicense the work; or
4. it grants this app permission to copy, embed, or redistribute the score.

Hymns for Worship may possess non-public licenses or correspondence. The public pages
reviewed do not establish their scope, so this project must not represent that publisher
approval has been independently verified.

### 2.3 Published site terms

The site's [Terms of Use](https://hymnsforworship.org/terms-of-use/) reserve its
intellectual-property rights, state that images may not be copied, modified, or
distributed except by permission, and require prior written consent for uses not granted
by the terms. The terms give some downloadable files at least a private, non-commercial
download permission, subject to any file-specific terms. That provision should not be
generalized into permission to reproduce all score images in an app.

A file returning HTTP 200, appearing in a sitemap, or being allowed by `robots.txt` means
that it is technically public. Those facts are not a copyright license or permission to
consume the host's bandwidth through an embedded image.

## 3. Copyright Layers and Evidentiary Limits

A hymnal entry can contain several legally distinct things:

- factual metadata such as a hymn number, author name, year, and scripture reference;
- a short title, which ordinarily receives little or no copyright protection by itself;
- protected lyrics, melody, harmony, or an arrangement;
- a publisher's selection and arrangement of the compilation; and
- Hymns for Worship's own notation, layout, image, or editorial material.

The app stores numbers, titles, and selected scripture references, not lyrics or notation.
This materially reduces risk. Under
[_Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co._](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/499/340/),
facts are not protected merely because someone collected them, although an original
selection or arrangement of facts can be. The project's metadata-only approach should
therefore be described as conservative risk reduction, not as a categorical ruling that
every aspect of the dataset is public domain.

Public availability and a copyright notice also do not answer whether the host obtained
permission. The U.S. Copyright Office notes that whether a protected work is being made
available with authority is a question of fact and recommends assuming protection when
clear information is absent. See its
[Fair Use FAQ](https://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-fairuse.html).

## 4. Link and Display Options Considered

| Technique | What the app does | Relative risk | Project decision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Page link with `#hymn-score` | Opens the source HTML page and scrolls to its score | Lowest of the considered options; preserves context and notices | **Use** |
| Raw-image navigation | Opens a `.png`/`.jpg` URL as the browser's page | Does not require the app to store the image, but bypasses the source page and lacks express site permission | Do not use without written approval |
| Remote-image embedding | Presents the host's image inside the app or an app-controlled page | Adds hotlinking, terms, jurisdictional, attribution, and bandwidth concerns | Do not use |
| Proxying, caching, or hosting | Makes and serves a project-controlled copy | Directly implicates reproduction and distribution rights | Prohibited without a reviewed license |

### 4.1 Why a hyperlink is not treated like a hosted copy

In [_Hunley v. Instagram_](https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2023/07/17/22-15293.pdf),
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reaffirmed the "server test" from
_Perfect 10 v. Amazon_: directing a browser to retrieve an image stored on somebody
else's server did not itself constitute direct infringement of the display right in that
jurisdiction. The opinion also records that some courts outside the Ninth Circuit have
rejected or limited that reasoning. It therefore does not support a nationwide,
categorical statement that all hyperlinking or embedding is noninfringing.

A normal external navigation link is more conservative than embedding because the user
leaves the app and views the host's own resource. (On iOS and Android the system browser
view opens on top of the app rather than switching apps, but the system browser, not the
app, loads and draws the host's page.) Nevertheless, secondary-liability, contract,
access-control, and jurisdiction-specific questions may remain if a developer knowingly
points users to infringing material or bypasses restrictions.

Section 512(d) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act contains a conditional safe harbor
for qualifying services that use information-location tools such as hyperlinks. It has
knowledge, financial-benefit, notice, and other compliance conditions and is not an
automatic license. See the U.S. Copyright Office's
[DMCA summary](https://www.copyright.gov/legislation/dmca.pdf).

### 4.2 Why the fragment link was selected

Representative pages for hymns 1, 214, and 689 were checked and each exposed a public
element named `hymn-score`. Later checks found that not every hymn has one: SDAH 509 has
no score on the site and no anchor. A URL fragment is handled by the browser after loading
the page; it does not request, copy, alter, or bypass access controls on the score. It gives
users a focused starting position while retaining the page that the site owner chose to
publish.

## 5. As-Built Technical Architecture

### 5.1 Metadata and search

`features/hymnal/EnglishHymnal.ts` stores the English hymn metadata as a
`Record<number, HymnEntry>`. `getSortedHymns` hydrates and sorts that record for the
hymnal page and its search across every hymnal. Search supports hymn numbers, titles, and
scripture references. The app also provides YouTube discovery and
Bible-reader navigation without storing third-party media.

### 5.2 External routing

`getEnglishHymnUrl` owns URL construction and is intentionally testable without opening a
browser. It:

1. pads numeric IDs to three digits;
2. appends `#hymn-score` for a selected hymn; and
3. returns the official directory when no number is supplied.

`openHymnal` passes that URL to `openInSystemBrowser` in `constants/ExternalLinks.ts`,
which uses `WebBrowser.openBrowserAsync` on iOS and Android and a new tab on web. Links
must continue to open in the system browser. Do not replace this handoff with an iframe,
WebView, remote `Image`, server-side proxy, service-worker cache, or downloaded local
asset.

### 5.3 Reader state

The hymnal page (`features/hymnal/HymnalScreen.tsx`), which lists the English hymnal
alongside the Chinese ones, retains each hymnal's search while the user visits the external
page and returns. The Bible link's way back reopens the page with the same hymn or search.
This preserves the user's place without importing the external content into the app.

### 5.4 Cross-references between hymnals

A hymn's number in another hymnal shows as a chip on its row, such as "505 · 23" on a 1985
hymn, and the search places those equivalents beside each match, so typing the number
someone gave finds it in every hymnal. Both read one registry, `HYMNAL_CROSS_REFERENCE_TABLES`
in `features/hymnal/HymnalNumberMappings.ts`, built from
`features/hymnal/HymnalNumberMappings.json`. It holds one table today: the congregation's
printed SDA Hymnal (1985) ↔ Chinese Hymnal (505) cross-reference.

To add a mapping, add an entry to `mappings` in the JSON: `sourceHymnalId` and
`targetHymnalId` (IDs from `features/hymnal/HymnalLabels.ts`, such as `chinese-hymnal-506`),
its `source` and `transcriptionReview`, and a `numberMap` from each source number to a list of
target numbers: several when a hymn has more than one equivalent, `null` for an asterisk in
the source, and no entry for a number the source doesn't list. Add the other direction as a
second entry when the source gives it; otherwise the app inverts the first. Declare a new
hymnal under `hymnals`, too.

Nothing else changes. Both hymnals' rows get chips, named with the other hymnal's short and
full names from `HymnalLabels.ts`; the search pairs the new equivalents with their matches;
a hymn in more than one table gets every chip; and `getHymnalCrossReferences`, which the
bulletin uses between its two primary hymnals, reads the same tables. Add the new pairs to
`test/hymnal-number-mappings.test.ts`; `test/hymnal-cross-reference-registry.test.ts` shows
a made-up table working end to end. The printed bulletin keeps its own copy of the 1985 ↔
505 maps in `google-apps-script/PrintedHymnLookup.gs`, and a hymnal the hymnal page doesn't
list yet needs its page entry first (see the
[bulletin hymn resolution guide](bulletin_hymn_resolution.md#changing-or-adding-a-primary-hymnal)).

## 6. Maintenance Rules

When changing this integration:

1. Keep selected-hymn destinations on the HTTPS `hymnsforworship.org` HTML origin and
   retain `#hymn-score`.
2. Do not derive or check in raw score-image URLs.
3. Do not download, cache, screenshot, transcode, proxy, or redistribute scores.
4. Do not state that Hymns for Worship or this app has publisher permission unless the
   applicable written grant has been reviewed and its scope documented.
5. Recheck representative public-domain and copyrighted hymn pages and the site's Terms
   of Use periodically. The daily **External Dependency Monitor**
   (`test/integration/external-dependencies.mjs`) already checks that the 1985 directory
   still lists at least 690 hymn links (the site's directory leaves out #262), that three
   hymn pages sampled each day still load at their own `sdah-NNN` path with the expected
   heading, and that SDAH 001 still has the `hymn-score` anchor. See
   [External dependency monitor](../operations/external-dependency-monitor.md).
6. Remove or disable a link promptly if a rights holder or the source site objects, the
   domain changes ownership, the destination begins redirecting unexpectedly, or the
   expected source page disappears.
7. Treat any future in-app score viewer as a new legal and architectural decision, not a
   cosmetic refactor.

The focused URL tests live in `test/english-hymnal.test.ts` and should cover both padded
hymn links and the no-number directory fallback. `test/external-url-generation.test.ts`
also checks that all 695 hymn numbers produce HTTPS `hymnsforworship.org` links.

## 7. Path to a Raw-Image Experience

If a future maintainer still wants raw-image navigation, the clean path is written
permission rather than reliance on a "loophole." Ask Hymns for Worship to authorize this
specific app to deep-link to its raw score images and to confirm that its underlying
rights permit that use for copyrighted hymns. Preserve the correspondence and any
conditions in the project's private organizational records; do not commit private contact
information or confidential agreements to this public repository.

Even with permission, prefer external-browser navigation, retain a visible source and
copyright link in the app, avoid caching, and provide a working takedown contact. A
license from the site owner only covers rights the site owner actually controls.
